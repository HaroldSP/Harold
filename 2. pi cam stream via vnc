#Previously, you need to install a vnc server on your raspberry and sign in in order to acces through cloud connectively.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install rpi-update
sudo rpi-update
raspivid -t 0 -f -awb greyworld 

# -t stands for timer, 0 means it will not stop untill you press ctrl+C, -awb greyworld gets rid away an annoying pink color scheme

# install мтс viewr on your phone, sign in and connect!
# if you can not see the video stream on your phone, check the preferences on the server part.
